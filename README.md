# MD_2_Course_Project: Automatic Designing of Flange Coupler using Python

When designing Flange Couplers is considered, it involves a lot of basic mathematical operations that are time-consuming and are doomed for mistakes as, in the end, human error is evident. 

This course project aims to create a python Algorithm in which customer has to input Power, RPM, FoS & Service factor and coupler will be designed with considering factors like a Shear failure, Compressive failure, Torsional Shearing & Crushing failure. 

For a broader application, Material Database, key Size Database & Coupler Empirical relations Database will be created from PSG Design Data book, and accordingly, appropriate values will be considered for design purposes. 

The program will give Text Output, which will have all the dimensions needed for manufacturing purposes & image output of two views of each Flange, Shaft & Key
